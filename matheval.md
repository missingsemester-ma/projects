# Math Expression Evaluator

# Problem statement

You are tasked with making a command line application that will be given math expressions in the form:

```
./your_binary '1 + (2 * 3 - 10.5)'
```

Your solution should produce a valid response or report that the expression provided is malformed.

You should support basic operations over integer and double values and you should support standard math functions like:

- `cos`, `acos`, `sin`, `asin`, `tan`, `atan`
- `sqrt`, `pow`

## Evaluation Criteria

1. All the functions above are supported and we can get evaluation values for the expressions
2. No use for existing engines, you should make it all from scratch (`eval` and the like)
3. A `README.md` file with documentation of how to build/run the project and any dependencies that should be available on the host.
4. Documentation should highlight the overall design and any tradeoffs performed and explain why.

## Submission

You can send an email to `hello@missingsemester.io` with the subject line `Missing Semester Spring Cohort: <Full Name> Submission`  The email should contain a link to a public GitHub repository for the project with all the necessary documentation.
